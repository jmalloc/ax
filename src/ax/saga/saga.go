// A Saga is a stateful message handler.
//
// They are typically used to model "long-running" business processes. They are
// the foundation on which aggregates and workflows are built.
//
// Each saga can have multiple instances, represented by the saga.Instance
// struct. Each instance has associated application-defined data, represented by
// the saga.Data interface.
//
// For each saga, an inbound message is always routed to one saga instance.
//
// Saga instances are persisted using an implementation of the Repository
// interface, which is typically provided by a specific persistence
// implementation.

	// may share any keys.

	// The key set is rebuilt whenever a message is received. It is persisted
