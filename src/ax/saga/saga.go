// A Saga is a stateful message handler.
//
// They are typically used to model "long-running" business processes. They are
// the foundation on which aggregates and workflows are built.
//
// Each saga can have multiple instances, represented by the saga.Instance
// struct. Each instance has associated application-defined data, represented by
// the saga.Data interface.
//
// For each saga, an inbound message is always routed to one saga instance.
//
// Saga instances are persisted using an implementation of the Repository
// interface, which is typically provided by a specific persistence
// implementation.

	// there are active saga instances.

	// they can not be routed to an existing instance, the HandleNotFound()
	// method is called instead.

	// contains this key in its key set.

	// Key sets must be disjoint. That is, no two instances of the same saga
	// may share any keys.
	//
	// The key set is rebuilt whenever a message is received. It is persisted
	// alongside the saga instance by the Repository.
	//
	// Extra care must be taken when introducing a new key to the set, as the key
	// set for existing saga instances will not be updated until they next receive
	// a message.
